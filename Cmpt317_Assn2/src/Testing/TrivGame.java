/** The class defines a "game" that can be expressed as an
 * explicit tree, for testing purposes.  The represetnation
 * allows one to identify a start state, the branching of the
 * tree (as a 2D array of integers) and the terminal nodes,
 * and their utilities.  It's not a wonderful design, but it
 * is good enough for testing.  
 *
 * Example: suppose we had a two player game in which
 * only Max gets to move.  
 *
 *    0
 *   / \
 *  1   2 
 * [7] [3] 
 *
 * (Okay, it's not much of a game, but it is very small.)
 *
 * The start state is 0
 * The successor array is {{1,2}}  - only one node has successors
 * The terminal states start at 1
 * The array of utilities of the terminal states is {7,3}
 *  
 * This is a simple way to specify game trees that you can construct
 * by hand, and are small enough to test and trace through.
 *
 * See the Example files for more examples.
